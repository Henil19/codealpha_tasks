# Language Translation Tool

This project is a simple language translation interface created as part of an internship task.  
It allows users to enter text, choose source & target languages, and receive translated output.

The tool uses:

- **Azure Translator API** (if an API key & region are provided)
- **Automatic fallback** to `deep-translator` (Google-based translation) when Azure isn’t configured

The interface also includes:
- Translate button  
- Clear button  
- Copy translated text  
- Text-to-speech (Speak) button  
- Source & Target language dropdowns  
- Live translation output
